# OVNRepo
A repository for OVN exams and labs. 

The project was used to present a virtualization of a nodal network architecture.
It represents a virtual simulation between the physical and network layer for networking. 

#Object Oriented Programming
Python is the main OOP language used in order to build the paradigm between the layers previously mentioned. 
Along with it, various libraries are used. These include: Pandas, Numpy, and MatPlotlib for the visualizations including net rate analysis between different nodes and different routes within the architecture, as well as mapping the impact of the varying bitrates. 

We used different mathematical models to simulate and represent the network elements and subsystems, for example the amplifiers installed along the route.
